// Command dispatch: turns one client-supplied line of text into an action
// against the running database and a text response. Deliberately pure
// engine logic - no sockets, no syscalls, no clock reads (rules.md #4:
// engine logic goes through injectable interfaces; there is nothing to
// inject here because Dispatch() needs none of those, which is exactly
// why this is split out from the platform-layer listener that calls it
// (TcpServer, tcp_server.hpp) - Dispatch() can be unit-tested directly,
// with no socket or thread involved.
//
// The SQL statements (CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE) are parsed by
// src/parser and executed here. Column types are resolved through
// Catalog::ResolveTypeByName() against sys.types, which stands in for the
// type registry that does not exist yet; src/exec/row_codec.hpp names
// exactly what that covers - no NULLs, no float or decimal columns,
// fixed-width ints and varchar only.
//
// CREATE TABLE also keeps a bare-name form with no parens, which asks for
// a zero-column table and therefore always errors now that every relation
// needs a Keystone pk column. The two forms are disambiguated by whether a
// '(' follows the table name.
//
// Protocol: one command per line, case-insensitive keyword, arguments
// space-separated. A response is always exactly one line back (never
// containing embedded newlines) - the platform-layer listener appends the
// line terminator itself.
//
// ---- WAL: INSERT is logged, nothing else is -----------------------------
//
// Given a WalManager, INSERT appends the records that describe it and does
// not answer the client until they are durable to the configured class
// (wal.md sections 1 and 5.2). Every other mutating path - CREATE TABLE,
// UPDATE, and the catalog rows underneath both - still writes pages
// outside the log, so a crash still loses them. INSERT went first because
// it is the path with a benchmark pointed at it; the others follow the
// same shape.
//
// One INSERT is one implicit transaction, and it emits:
//
//     TXN_BEGIN
//     [FULL_PAGE_IMAGE  of the old tail]  only when the chain grew
//     [PAGE_INIT        of the new tail]  only when the chain grew
//     HEAP_INSERT       the tuple, its slot, its writer
//     TXN_COMMIT        + the durability class's wait
//
// The FULL_PAGE_IMAGE is there because chain growth mutates two pages: the
// new page's `next_page_id` link lives in the *old* tail's header, and a
// new page redo cannot reach is a new page redo cannot use. No record type
// describes a link edit on its own (record.hpp's enum is frozen and
// append-only, so inventing one is a format-version event), and an FPI is
// the existing record that makes a page whole. It costs one page of log
// per page of heap - roughly +50% log volume on small rows - and it is
// paid once per 8 KB of tuples, never per tuple. A HEAP_CHAIN_LINK record
// type would remove it; that is a format decision, not this file's.
//
// ---- Clustered type: one dispatcher, two storages ----------------------
//
// A relation is either a chain of heap pages (`ClusteredType::kHeap`,
// heap_chain.hpp) or a clustered B+ tree (`kBtree`, btree.hpp), and every
// statement handler below branches on `TableAccess::clustered_type` in
// exactly one place - `InsertIntoRelation`, `VisitRelation`, `LocateByPk`.
// Everything else in this file is storage-agnostic, which is possible
// because a btree **leaf is a heap page**: the row codec, `PageView`
// reads/overwrites, `HEAP_INSERT` and the `SHOW PAGE` dump all work on
// either without knowing which they hold.
//
// The observable differences are narrow and worth stating:
//
//   - `SELECT`/`UPDATE ... WHERE id = <n>` on a btree relation descends
//     the tree, which is **authoritative** - a miss means the row does not
//     exist, and no scan follows. The same statement on a heap relation
//     scans the chain, because a heap relation has no pk index at all.
//   - `INSERT` may split a leaf and grow the tree a level, in which case
//     the relation's `desc_page_id` is repointed at the new root before
//     the client is answered.
//   - A full scan of either is a left-to-right walk of the same
//     `next_page_id` links, so `SELECT *` returns rows in the same order.
//
// ---- Ordering: the records are appended after the page is mutated -------
//
// ChainInsert() writes the tuple into the page frame, and only then are
// the records appended and page_lsn stamped. That is safe here, and the
// reason is narrow enough to be worth stating: the server is a single
// cooperative thread (sched.md), the checkpoint and drain tasks are other
// tasks on it, and nothing suspends between the mutation and the stamp -
// so no flush can observe the page in between. What protects the interval
// is the store's WAL gate (device_page_store.hpp): once page_lsn is
// stamped, no write-back can outrun the log. A path that ever suspends
// mid-statement must generate the record while holding the page latch
// instead, which is what wal.md section 8-1 actually asks for.
